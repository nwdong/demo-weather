# function
It's a web application demo to display current weather for capital cities in Australian. There is a dropdown list on web page for city selection, when city is changed corresponding real-time weather information should be displayed dynamically.

# design summary
Overall, this system is based on RESTful architecture. Spring framework is used for backend, AngularJS framework is used for frontend. 

Spring Boot and angular-seed are used for quick bootstrap, so the first workable version costs about 8 hours in 2 days (document change, UI layout tunning and more cities added later).
